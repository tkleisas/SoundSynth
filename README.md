# SoundSynth
A very simple synthesizer written in java.
Programmed in Netbeans.
Contains code from https://gist.github.com/rjeschke/1210000 for the main audio thread implementing the audio callback for sound generation.
Contains code from mozzi sloppily ported to java: https://github.com/sensorium/Mozzi/blob/master/LowPassFilter.h
For now the code plays a simple ditty (drums and lead)
